# Security Testing Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the security testing conducted on the sample e-commerce web application.

## Findings

### SQL Injection
- **Tested Input**: `1' OR '1'='1`
- **Result**: No vulnerabilities detected. The application did not process the SQL injection attempt.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Tested Input**: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
- **Result**: No vulnerabilities detected. The application did not execute the script, indicating effective input sanitization.

## Recommendations
1. **Input Validation**: Continue to implement strong input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
2. **Use Prepared Statements**: For any database interactions, use prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection risks.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a CSP to further protect against XSS attacks.
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
The sample web application appears to be secure against the tested vulnerabilities. However, ongoing vigilance and adherence to security best practices are essential.
