## Overview
This document outlines the process for conducting security testing on a sample web application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Objectives
- Identify vulnerabilities in the web application.
- Document findings in a security report.
- Provide mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.

## Types of Vulnerabilities to Test
1. **SQL Injection**: Test for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Test for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

## Testing Methodology
1. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
2. **Automated Tools**: Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for vulnerabilities.
3. **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual testing to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.

## Deliverables
- **Security Report**: A detailed report documenting identified vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation strategies.
  - **Vulnerability Details**: Description of each identified vulnerability.
  - **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact of each vulnerability on the application.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommended actions to remediate each vulnerability.

## Conclusion
This README provides a guide for conducting security testing on web applications. Following these instructions will help ensure that the application is secure against common vulnerabilities.
